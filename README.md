# Browser-based Javascript game
A browser-based Javascript game. This is a school project (but it's really fun).

The goal is to get rid of as many letters on the screen as possible by pressing the keyboard before the time is up. Be careful, if you press a key but the letter is not on the screen, you'll lose some points.
